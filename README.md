# Sunny Side Up!

This is the code for my first StreamLit app. Based on a project I worked on (all notebooks for that project are in the notebooks folder), this app was made to try to predict upcoming nice days! Overall project goal is to see if I can use data from https://www.renewables.ninja/ to predict when to have a picnic!
